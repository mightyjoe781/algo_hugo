      <description>Why we use graphs Graphs help us model a specific type of data that has some dependency and relationships.
Eg. Facebooks friends data, Routes between cities and places (models the connectivity and distance) , Networking (connectivity), Pre-requisite of courses (knowledge and dependency), File Systems, Resource Allocation in OS (handling deadlocks).
Representation of Graphs Represented as a Nodes and edges. Nodes : data while edge represents relationships.
Most Simplest implementation is adjacency matrix but its not memory efficient for sparse graphs.</description>

      <description>Strong and Weak Connectivity These terms arise in Directed Graph.
Weak Connectivity : Take a directed graph and convert into undirected graph and do connectivity operations on that is called as weak connectivity.
Strong Connectivity : (A,B) are strongly connected $\iff \exist $ path b/w A &amp;amp; B.
â€‹ A &amp;ndash;&amp;gt; B and B&amp;ndash;&amp;gt;A
Graph Cyclicity Cycle : A sequence of nodes and edges such that first and last node of sequence is same.</description>
