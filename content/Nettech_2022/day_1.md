# Day1

Every computer/server/router/mobile on a network has unique Physical Address - MAC Address.

MAC : Media Access Control is a 6 byte hexadecimal. e.g. `a1:00:ff:12:bc:de` which can't be changed because its permanently embedded on network card.

On windows type : `ipconfig /all` and on macOS/linux machines just type : `ifconfig`.

Note : you can't change MAC address, all the different tools available just hide/mask your original MAC address. MAC address is accessible only on local network.

MAC address can't do routing and it works only on its own network.

Logical Address : IP address is more suitable and useful for routing. There are 2 naming schemes : ipv4 and ipv6. As a result its logical address, its temporary and it may change when you log out from network. This is automatically assigned by DHCP server.

ipv4 : 32 bit address, while ipv6 : 128 bit address.

Every IP address comes with a subnet mask i.e. 255.255.255.0 

localhost address/loopback address : 127.0.0.1

# Day2

Class of IP address : say 192.168.1.100

- 0-127     - A class address - N.H.H.H
- 128-191 - B class address - N.N.H.H
- 192-223 - C class address - N.N.N.H

- network address is - 192.168.1.0 (first address)
- host address is - 192.168.1.100
- broadcast - 192.168.1.255 (last address)

Effectively you have network-2 addresses

Another example - B Class network 150.1.1.100

- na - 150.1.0.0
- ba - 150.1.255.255

Concept of Private IP Address
All the IPs are hidden by router so public IP address is of the router.
