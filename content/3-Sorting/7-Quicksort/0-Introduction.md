### Introduction

Quicksort is most widely used sorting algorithm than any other algorithm.

Invented in 1960 by C.A.R. Hoare.

- easy to implement 
- resource efficient in many cases

features

- in-place
- $N \log N $ on avg case

drawbacks

- Not stable
- $N^2$ in worst case
- fragile ( any small mistake in implementation can go un-noticed and cause bad performance)

STL library uses `qsort` function.

Performance of the quicksort is highly dependent on the input.
