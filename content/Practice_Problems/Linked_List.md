### Basic Problems

#### Reversing a Linked List

![image-20210412105712587](/Linked_List.assets/image-20210412105712587.png)



There can multiple ways to do this but simplest is just making a new head and keep pushing items on the new head ( reverse automatically) 

````c++
link reverse(link head){
   	link x = head; // copy of head ( good practice )
    link rev = nullptr,tmp ;
    while(x){
        tmp = x->next; // increment the list
        x -> next = rev;
        rev = x;
        x = tmp;
    }
    return rev;
}
````

// its a suffix subproblem case 

Recursive approach

````c++
// head is declared globaly
link rev(link x){
	if(x == nullptr) return nullptr;
    if(x->next == nullptr){
        head = x;
        return x;
    }
    link node1 = rev(x->next);
    node1->next = x;
    x->next = nullptr;
    return x;
}
````

### Important Algorithms

#### Floyd's tortoise and hare

Given a linked list with cycles find whether the list contains cycle of not.

Solution : Its quite simple just consider two pointers but they move at different speed. Fast pointer goes into cycle before the slow one and if there exists a cycle they are guaranteed to meet somewhere in the cycle.

Code Illustration

````c++
// suppose a struct node exists. and link is just typedef on *node
link isCycle(link head){
    link slow = head , fast = head;
    while(!fast && !fast->next && slow!=fast){
        slow = slow -> next;
        fast = fast -> next -> next;
    }
    // the moment loop ends we hit the point at which both meet
    if(!fast || !fast->next) return nullptr;
    return slow;
}
// above function returns null if there is no cycle else it return the point where the cycle exists.

````

*Property:* Slow pointer always travels half of the fast pointer.

#### Problem Extension :

Find the moment where the cycle started. Refer to figure.

lets say $n$ represent the distance where the cycle started and $k$ where the turtle and hare meet after some revolutions. And lets assume cycle is of size $m$.

let, distance traveled by slow = $i$ , then distance by fast pointer = $2i$.

lets simulate the run. $i = n + m*p_1 + k $  where $ p_1 :$ number of cycle it took to hit the meeting point.

similarly for fast pointer $ 2i = n + m * p_2 + k $  here $p_2 :$ number of cycle for fast pointer.

Simplifying $n+k = m * (p_2 - 2p_1)$

or we can see it as  $ n + k = m * integer$ .This implies $n+k$ always wraps around circle. 

or Diamond point is n distance (direction of cycle) away from head of list.

![CycleDetection](/Linked_List.assets/Untitled-1618199481579.png)

````c++
link diamond = isCycle(head), hptr = head; // good practice to not change given head
while(diamond!=hptr){
    diamond = diamond->next;
    head = head->next
}

[Find the duplicate number](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-duplicate-number/submissions/)

This problem is excellent demonstration of above concept xD;

Possible ways are n number sum, xor ( failed cause repeating numbers can be more than 1 ).

we can maintain visited array. extra space O(n) ;)

we can fix space usage by using negative numbers as markers using this `nums[abs(nums[i])] = -1 nums[abs(nums[i])] `.

also we can sort and find neighbors with same value. 

best solution is using the above concept.

visualize : `nums = [1, 3, 4, 2, 2]`

â€‹	think empty link linked (val -> null) while there is a next link which is defined by the `num[i]` ;) so `nums[i]` acts as link for linked list traversal right , so we can traverse array in specific manner ( similar to linked list)

`slow = nums[i];`

`fast = nums[nums[i]];`

:-) 

#### Some problems and their hints :

[Palindrome Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-linked-list/)

Just find the mid point using slow and fast pointer and then reverse the second half of list and compare.

[Remove nth from end of list](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-nth-node-from-end-of-list/)

Use the slow and fast pointer approach but :D at **<u> n distance</u>**, just be careful of edge cases.

[Reverse the nodes in K-group](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-nodes-in-k-group/)

Insert at the head as well as tail. Connecting various groups.

#### Medium Questions

 // lookup merge step of merge sort

[Merge 2 sorted list](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-sorted-lists/)

````c++
void insert(link *r,link *h){
	(*r)->next = (*h);
    (*h) = (*h)->next;
}
link merge(link h1, link h2){
        link res = new ListNode();
        link ans = res;
        while(h1!=NULL || h2!=NULL){
            if(h1 == NULL) { insert(&res,&h2); break;}
            if(h2 == NULL) { insert(&res,&h1); break;}
            if(h1->val <= h2->val) insert(&res,&h1);
            else insert(&res,&h2);
            res = res->next;
        }
        return ans->next;
}
````

[Add two numbers](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers/)

Use recursion.

// Recursion Revisited...

How can we get the function to return values. Two ways : either returning explicitly or using implicitly ( arguments passed by reference).

Explicitly returning function

`int f(..) {`

`/// some body`

`}`

when we call this function we can store it in a variable say `int y= f(..)` and then we can operate on `y`

another way

Implicitly returning function

we can declare `y` ahead of time and call the function with y as a argument (passed as reference) and then function actually changes the `y`.

Solution when lists are of equal length.

Now real catch is both are unequal size... :D

What if we pad the unequal linked list to get them to equal size :)

// code is still buggy (to do fix it)

````c++
link f(link l1, link l2, int &carry){
    if(!l1){
      	carry = 0;
        return nullptr;
    }

    int passed_carry;
    link summed_list = f(l1->next,l2->next,passed_carry);
    
    int curr_elt = (l1->val + l2->val + passed_carry)%10;
    int curr_carry = (l1->val + l2->val + passed_carry)/10;
    
    link curr_node = new ListNode(curr_elt);
    curr_node -> next = summed_list;
    // implicit return
    carry = curr_carry;
   	// explicit return
    return curr_node;
}
link addTwoNumbers(link l1,link l2){
    //------------------------------------------------------
    // Padding Logic
    
   	link curr_l1 = l1, curr_l2 = l2;
    while(curr_l1 && curr_l2){
        curr_l1 = curr_l1->next;
        curr_l2 = curr_l2->next;
    }
    
    ListNode dummy;
   	link new_l1,new_l2,pad_list = &dummy,rem_list;
    
    if(curr_l1){
        rem_list = curr_l1;
        new_l1 = l1;
        pad_list->next = l2;
    } else {
        rem_list = curr_l2;
        new_l1 = l2;
        pad_list->next = l1;
    }
    // creating padding zeros.
    while(rem_list){
        link tmp = new ListNode(0);
        tmp->next = pad_list->next;
        pad_list->next = tmp;
        rem_list = rem_list->next;
    }
    // pad_list has all 0s we need;
    new_l2 = pad_list -> next;
    // new_l2 is always shorter list 
    // l1 is always longer list
    
    //------------------------------------------------------
    int carry;
    link res  = f(new_l1,new_l2,carry);
    link curr = res;
    if(carry){
        curr = new ListNode(carry);
        curr-> next = res;
    }
    return curr;
}
