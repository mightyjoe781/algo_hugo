### Binary Search

- Predicate Framework

Key elements related to search.

- Search Space
- Item : certain properties
- Algorithm

Binary Search is a search algorithm which utilizes some property of search space.

- When can binary search be applied ?
- What all can be find ?
- Pseudo Code.

Terminology

1. **Predicate** : Boolean functions.

   Boolean function maps items to $f : D\rightarrow \{T,F\}$, true or false.

2. **Apply Predicate on a Search Space**

   Defining the predicate value of each item.

3. **When is BS applicable**

   Binary Search is applicable $iff$ $\exists$ a predicate s.t. when you apply the Predicate on the search space s.t. the relation $p(x) \implies p(y)\  \forall y > x$ is true when we apply the predicate on search space.

   If $p(x)$ is True then $p(y)$ is True  $\forall y > x$

   Means its a series like this :  FFFFFFTTTTTTTTT (F\*T\*)

   So if this statement is true then its contrapositive is also true.

   $\neg p(y) \implies p(x)\  \forall y > x$

   Means its a series like this : TTTTTTTTTFFFFFF (T\*F\*)

4. **If Binary Search is applicable then what can u conclude**

   - In (F\*T\*) we can find *last F* and *first T.*
   - In (T\*F\*) we can find *last T* and *first F*.

##### Strategy to solve Binary Search Problems

- Find ordering and a predicate s.t. F * T* and finding the last F or the first T will solve the problem.

Question

Find the first and last position of an element (target) in the array.

e. g. $A= [2,2,5,5,7,7,7,9,10,15]$  , target = 7.

Answer will be : [4,6] (assuming 0 indexing).

First Position : p(x) : ?? Find predicate ??

Predicate should reduce it to (F*T *) and last F / last T should give answer.

Simple p(x) : x >= target and first T solves the problem or alternatively x < target and first F.

Similarly for last position : p(x) : x <= target and last T solves the problem.

- Pseudo Code for F * T \*

  - last F

    ````c++
    lo = first_elt, hi = last_elt;
    while(lo < hi){
        mid = lo+(hi-lo+1)/2
    	if(p(mid))
            hi = mid-1;
        else lo = mid;
    }
    // one element
    if(!p(lo)) return lo;
    return -1;
    ````

  - first T

    ````c++
    lo = first_elt, hi = last_elt;
    while(lo < hi){
        mid = lo + (hi-lo)/2;
    	if(p(mid))
            hi = mid;
        else lo = mid+1;
    }
    // one element
    if(p(lo)) return lo;
    return -1;
    ````

  There are 2 mid

  - odd elements : well defined mid = (lo+hi)/2 = lo + (hi-lo)/2 (overflow fix)
  - even elements
    - low_mid = (lo+hi)/2 = lo + (hi-lo)/2 (overflow fix)
    - high_mid = lo + (hi-lo+1)/2
  - so we will decide mid is look inside if construct of predicate
    - includes mid element = low_mid
    - doesn't mid element = high_mid

- Pseudo Code for T\*F\*

  - Last T
  - First F

[Find minimum in Rotated sorted array](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-in-rotated-sorted-array/)

Predicate Framework! We want to reduce it to F* T* format and find the last F/first T.

If we plot the values on a graph we see that values in any rotated array will be like this 

![image-20210511211551169](/Binary_Search_1.assets/image-20210511211551169.png)

We see that the threshold is at first element. We want predicate such that above threshold it gives us false and True for other values.

$p(x) : x < A[0]$ 

and we want `first T`

````c++
int findMin(vector<int>& nums) {
    if(nums.empty()) return 0;
    int n = nums.size();
    int lo = 0,hi = n-1;
    while(lo < hi) {
        int mid = lo + (hi-lo)/2;
        if(nums[mid]<nums[0]) hi = mid;
        else lo = mid+1;
    }
	if(nums[lo] < nums[0]) return nums[lo];
    else return nums[0];
}

[Peak index in a mountain array](https://leetcode.com/problems/peak-index-in-a-mountain-array/)

predicate : slope :=`A[i] > A[i+1]` type F* T*  solution first T

````c++
int peakIndexInMountainArray(vector<int>& arr) {
    int n = arr.size(),lo,hi,mid;
    int lo=0,hi=n-1;

    while(lo < hi) {
        mid = lo + (hi-lo)/2;
        if(arr[mid] > arr[mid+1])
            hi = mid;
        else
            lo = mid+1;
    }
    // no need of sanity check (given in question!)
    return lo;

#### Optimization Problems

Problems where we have to optimize a variable under some constraints.

- What kind of optimization problems can Binary Search enable to solve ?
- Systematic approach for identifying such problems & solving them.

[Find the Smallest divisor given a threshold](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-smallest-divisor-given-a-threshold/)

So this problem represents a group of classic problems which are basically based on guessing the solution! How can we guess the solution ? Notice every solution to problem (consider solves or not) exhibits monotonicity !

If one solution solves the problem then all the previous solution will solve the solution.

So basically keep guessing divisor if solution doesn't match decrease upper bound  and if this is a solution then increase lower bound until we found a point where monotonicity changes ( first F , last T).

Lets say inflexion point is $x_k$

for all $x_i < x_k$ , $s_i > t$

â€‹			$x_i \ge x_k$ , $s_i \le t$

Then problem is F* T*

````c++
int getSum(vector<int>& nums, int k){
    int sum = 0;
    for(int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++)
        sum += ceil((float)nums[i]/k);
    return sum;
}
int smallestDivisor(vector<int>& nums, int threshold) {
    int max_elt = INT_MIN, i, n = nums.size(), lo, hi, mid;
    for(i = 0; i < n; i++)
        max_elt = max(max_elt,nums[i]);

    lo = 1, hi = max_elt;
    while(lo < hi){
        mid = lo+(hi-lo)/2;
        if(getSum(nums,mid) <= threshold)
            hi = mid;
        else
            lo = mid+1;
    }
    return lo;
}
````

Above problem was solvable because x under certain condition was monotonic.

Approach

- Define Search Space -> x

- Trim SS (from both ends)

- p(x) <- constraint

  f(x) <= t or f(x) >= t

- first T
